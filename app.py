We recognized a challenge within the warehousing and ecommerce industries in regard to the time required to sort and store various products. Our solution to this problem was the implementation of a warehouse management system composed of 4-degree-of-freedom (4DOF) robotic arms that could handle the picking and placing of a wide range of products. Each product was equipped with a unique Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag for identification purposes. The sorting process began as products were placed onto a conveyor belt, where they were then scanned by an RFID scanner. The resulting signal was sent to an ARDUINO board for processing, which allocated space for the product in the warehouse. This was achieved by using infrared sensors placed in the storage areas to identify available space. The system then sent signals to the robotic arm to pick up and place the product in the correct location. To improve the efficiency of the system, we integrated a record and play system into the robot's hands, allowing operators to train the system according to their specific needs. The proposed system offers flexibility for use in various warehouses and storage spaces. """)

The primary objective of this workshop was to learn how to program and operate a quadruped robot. In order to receive a certificate, participants were required to complete a project utilizing the robot. I decided to attach a rotating brush to the front of the robot, effectively creating a mini-robotic cleaner. The key advantage of using a quadruped as a cleaning robot is the relatively small surface area it covers on the ground, compared to other types of cleaning robots. This design feature eliminates the need for a sweeper on the rear of the robot, which is often present in other types of cleaning robots. The robot kit used in this project included an Arduino controller, 3D printed robotic parts, 8 servo motors, and an ultrasonic sensor.")
